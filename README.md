# Module 3 Challenge
## Random Password Generator

## Description
This challenge was indeed just that- a challenge- for me to accomplish. Through finishing it, I was able to grasp some basic JavaScript concepts in order to further my developing career.  The assignment called for windows asking the user questions regarding their choice of characters used for their password.  I am glad that I set forth and acccomplished my goal of building this application.  

Upon the page loading, a red button (Generate Password) appears at the bottom of the window.  When the user clicks the button, they are prompted to answer questions regarding the desired password length and whether or not they wish for the inclusion of numbers, special characters, upper, and or lower case letters within said password. The application then generates a random password containing the selected criteria and displays it in the text box.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The user first selects the red "generate password" button in the lower-middle of the window.  The user is then prompted to answer questions about the contents of the password to be generated.  Upon answering the last prompt, a random password based on criteria input by the user is generated and displayed in the text box.
